  <h3>One of the first events of the 1970s was the break-up of The Beatles in the spring of 1970. Paul McCartney formed a new group, Wings, and continued to enjoy great mainstream success. The three other former Beatles —<font color="red"> John Lennon, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr — all continued hugely successful recording careers throughout the decade and beyond.</font> Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison all released extremely successful solo albums in 1970, Imagine, McCartney, and All Things Must Pass, and several of their songs are listed among the biggest hits of the 1970s: <u>Wings' "Silly Love Songs" and "My Love," and Harrison's "My Sweet Lord.</h3></u>

  <font color="yellow"><u><h2>70s Hard Rock:</h2></u></font>
  <h3>
Heavy metal music gained a cult following in the 1970s,<u><font color="red">led by Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, and Deep Purple</font></u>, with their styles later influencing other bands like<u><font color="red"> Judas Priest and Motörhead</font>, which eventually started<u><font color="red"> the new wave of British heavy metal</font> in the 1980s.

Black Sabbath, formed in 1968 (as The Polka Tulk Blues Band, then Earth), is often credited with inventing the metal genre as well as stoner rock, doom metal, as well as sparking a revolution with much darker lyrics than were the norm in rock at that time.

 <font color="yellow"><u><h2>70s Progressive Rock:</h2></u></font>
 <h3>
  Paul McCartney and Wings on the Wings Over the World tour, 1976
Progressive or prog rock developed out of <font color="green">late 1960s blues-rock and psychedelic rock.</font> Dominated by British bands, it was part of an attempt to elevate rock music to new levels of artistic credibility. Progressive rock bands attempted to push the technical and compositional boundaries of rock by going beyond the standard verse-chorus-based song structures.<font color="white"> The arrangements often incorporated elements drawn from classical, jazz, and world music. Instrumentals were common, while songs with lyrics were sometimes conceptual, abstract, or based in fantasy.</font> Progressive rock bands sometimes used "concept albums that made unified statements, usually telling an epic story or tackling a grand overarching theme. <font color="#A31728">King Crimson as well as the Moody Blues</font> have been seen as the bands who established the concept of "progressive rock". The term was applied to the music of bands such as<font color="#A31728"> Yes, Genesis, Pink Floyd, Jethro Tull, Rush, and Emerson, Lake & Palmer.</font> It reached its peak of popularity in the mid-1970s, but had mixed critical acclaim and the punk movement can be seen as a reaction against its musicality and perceived pomposity. Nevertheless, Pink Floyd's 1973 release, The Dark Side of the Moon, was an immediate success, remaining in the charts for 741 weeks from 1973 to 1988, with an estimated 50 million copies sold. It is Pink Floyd's most commercially successful album and one of the best-selling albums worldwide. It has twice been remastered and re-released, and has been covered in its entirety by several other acts. It spawned two singles, "Money" and "Time". In addition to its commercial success, The Dark Side of the Moon is one of Pink Floyd's most popular albums among fans and critics, and is frequently ranked as one of the greatest rock albums of all time.</h3>

 <font color="yellow"><u><h2>70s Glam Rock:</h2></u></font>
 <h3>
  Glam or glitter rock developed in the UK in the post-hippie early 1970s. <font color="#23CE68"><u>It was characterized by outrageous clothes, makeup, hairstyles, and platform-soled boots.The flamboyant lyrics, costumes, and visual styles of glam performers were a campy, playing with categories of sexuality in a theatrical blend of nostalgic references to science fiction and old movies</u></font>, all over a guitar-driven<font color="white"> hard rock sound.Pioneers of the genre included David Bowie, Roxy Music, Mott the Hoople, Marc Bolan,</font> and T.Rex.These, and many other acts straddled the divide between pop and rock music, managing to maintain a level of respectability with rock audiences, while enjoying success in the singles chart, including <font color="white">Queen and Elton John.</font> Other performers aimed much more directly for the popular music market, where they were the dominant groups of their era, including Slade, Sweet, and Mud.The glitter image was pushed to its limits by Gary Glitter and The Glitter Band. Largely confined to the British, glam rock peaked during the mid-1970s, before it disappeared in the face of punk rock and new wave trends.</h3>

  <font color="yellow"><u><h2>70s Soft rock:</h2></u></font>

<h2>Singer Rod Stewart</h2> <h3> performing in 1976. He was one of the major British soft rock artists of the 1970s
From the late 1960s it became common to divide mainstream rock music into soft rock and hard rock. Soft rock was often derived from folk rock, using acoustic instruments and putting more emphasis on melody and harmonies.It reached its commercial peak in the mid- to late-1970s with acts like the reformed Fleetwood Mac, whose Rumours (1977) was the best-selling album of the decade.<font color="yellow"><u>Major British soft rock artists of the 1970s included 10cc, Mungo Jerry, the Hollies, Rod Stewart, the Alan Parsons Project, and Paul McCartney and Wings.</u></font> Some of the most successful singers and songwriters were Cat Stevens, Steve Winwood, Albert Hammond, and Elton John.</h3>
  
  <font color="yellow"><u><h2>70s Punk rock:</h2></u></font>
<h2>The mid-1970</h2><h3><font color="yellow"><u> saw the rise of punk music from its protopunk-garage band roots in the 1960s and early 1970s. The Sex Pistols and The Clash were some of the earliest British acts to make it big in both the United Kingdom and the United States.</u></font> Groups like the Clash were noted for the experimentation of style, especially that of having strong ska influences in their music. Punk music has also been heavily associated with a certain punk fashion and absurdist humour which exemplified a genuine suspicion of mainstream culture and values. The Sex Pistols caused a major sensation in 1977 and were the first serious challenge to the established rock groups like the Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin, although the punk era in Britain lasted only three years and effectively ended with the Pistols' breakup.</h3>
