        <font color="yellow"><h2>The 1950s: birth of rock</h2></font>
<h2>Coming from black music, blues, rock adopts a binary rhythm, that is to say that a single beat is divided into two equal halves. The blues is based on a ternary rhythm, that is to say that a beat is divided into three equal parts. At its beginnings in the 1950s, in the United States, rock was struggling to develop.</h2>

<h3>One of the first genres of rock appears under the name of rockabilly, thanks to the composition of a title by one of the most emblematic characters of rock'n'roll, Elvis Presley, singer and guitarist nicknamed The King ("The King") . Wealthy American society then rejected this movement, but by the end of the 1950s, the number of softer songs increased. The composition of many of these pieces will give birth to pop music, softer and more melodious than rock'n'roll. But this is developing slowly, in more local forms.</h3>

<h4>Some of the best-known American rock singers of this period include (along with<font color="yellow"> Elvis Presley</font>) <font color="red">Bill Haley</font>,<font color="yellow"> Eddie Cochrane</font>, <font color="blue">Buddy Holly,</font> <font color="green">Chuck Berry</font>,<font color="white"> Gene Vincent,</font> etc. Rock singers of the 1950s are nicknamed Pioneers rock by some specialists.</h4>
