        <u><font color="yellow"><h2>60s Rock:</h2></font></u>
<h2>Rock'n'roll, ostensibly rebellious and energetically independent, caused a movement of rejection on the part of good American society, which believed that it had triumphed over this movement in 1959. The death of rock'n'roll was then announced and it was true that in the United States, the movement seems to be running out of steam. The singers are now very consensual and Elvis Presley is institutionalized, confined to ballads and gospel, and seems more interested in his film career than in music.</h2><h3> However, rock'n'roll continues to develop in more local and confidential forms such as surf music on the west coast or garage music in the north. Towards the end of the 1950s and the beginning of the 1960s,<font color="white"> <u> we heard more and more “wiser”, “softer” rock'n'roll titles, which were to engender pop music: The Everly Brothers: All I Have To Do Is Dream in 1958, rock'n'roll, Johnny Burnette: Dreamin and You're Sixteen in 1960 (composed by the Sherman Brothers), Del Shannon: Runaway in 1961, Brian Hyland: Sealed with a Kiss in 1962, or Lee Dorsey with Ya Ya in 1962.</h3></u></font>

The "pure" rock'n'roll and rockabilly tends to disappear, apart from a few rare hits like (Oh!) Pretty Woman by Roy Orbison in 1964 and Wooly Bully by Sam the Sham and the Pharaohs in 1965. The first followers of<font color="white"> <u>Elvis Presley appear, like Cliff Richard, and small formations multiply to imitate them. Chuck Berry's American influence is profound.</u></font> Along the way, however, rock'n'roll acclimatized and The Shadows, who accompanied Cliff Richard, initiated the archetype of the rock formation as it would be taken up both in Europe and on the other side of the Atlantic. : the double bass disappears in favor of the bass guitar, two guitarists share the tasks of the rhythm for the first and the "chorus" for the second. British groups thus quickly moved away from their American model to create original music that French speakers call<font color="white"> <u>“British rock”.</u></font>

<h3><u>The Beatles accentuated the work on melody and vocal harmonies and gave birth to pop music,</u> while the "British Blues Boom" movement returned to blues roots, favoring syncopated rhythms and more aggressive sounds. The Rolling Stones emerge as the spearhead of this British rock. Parallel branches then multiplied: groups such as The Who, The Troggs, The Small Faces and The Kinks developed the mod movement, while The Animals or The Yardbirds created British blues rock. The richness of British creation is flourishing and definitively imposes on the world level a musical genre which becomes emblematic of the second half of the 20th century. Result obtained after what the Americans designated as the "British Invasion", following the beatlemania and the eventful passages at home of the Rolling Stones and the Kinks (which moreover bore the brunt of a ban on American soil organized by local authorities).

The rock then branches out almost endlessly by exploring seemingly improbable niches. <u>Jazz fusion was born out of this research, which began in the 1960s.</h3></u>
